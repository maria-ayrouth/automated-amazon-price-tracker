# automated-amazon-price-tracker


one of the things that i've noticed about lot of items on Amazon os that the price really fluctuates . so we've been keeping yours eyes on this product for a while now and we've seen it go up and down even on a day to day basis sometimes .

by this prog we will get an email and it tell me the product price alert that  the product in now below your target price , go ahead and buy now.
by using this program , instead of having to check it ourselves , we now get notified when our condition is met . 

this is going to invlolve a little bit of web scraping , where we try to get hold of the value of this price and we turn it into a number and we c heck it against our target price , and then when the conditions are met then we use the SMTP module to send ourselves an email .
